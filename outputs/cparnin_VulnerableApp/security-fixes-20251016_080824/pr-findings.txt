Detailed Findings:
1. User data flows into the host portion of this manually-constructed URL. This could allow an attacker to send data to their own server, potentially exposing sensitive data such as cookies or authorization information sent with this request. They could also probe internal servers or other resources that the server running this code can access. (This is called server-side request forgery, or SSRF.) Do not allow arbitrary hosts. Instead, create an allowlist for approved hosts, hardcode the correct host, or ensure that the user data can only affect the path or parameters. (high - semgrep)
2. Untrusted input might be used to build an HTTP request, which can lead to a Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. SSRF allows an attacker to send crafted requests from the server side to other internal or external systems. SSRF can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and, in some cases, allow the attacker to control applications or systems that trust the vulnerable service. To prevent this vulnerability, avoid allowing user input to craft the base request. Instead, treat it as part of the path or query parameter and encode it appropriately. When user input is necessary to prepare the HTTP request, perform strict input validation. Additionally, whenever possible, use allowlists to only interact with expected, trusted domains. (high - semgrep)

5. User data flows into this manually-constructed SQL string. User data can be safely inserted into SQL strings using prepared statements or an object-relational mapper (ORM). Manually-constructed SQL strings is a possible indicator of SQL injection, which could let an attacker steal or manipulate data from the database. Instead, use prepared statements (`connection.PreparedStatement`) or a safe library. (high - semgrep)
6. Untrusted input might be used to build a database query, which can lead to a SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker can execute malicious SQL statements and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify, delete data, or execute arbitrary system commands. To prevent this vulnerability, use prepared statements that do not concatenate user-controllable strings and use parameterized queries where SQL commands and user data are strictly separated. Also, consider using an object-relational (ORM) framework to operate with safer abstractions. To build SQL queries safely in Java, it is possible to adopt prepared statements by using the `java.sql.PreparedStatement` class with bind variables. (critical - semgrep)
